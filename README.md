This repository contains my website in GitHub format to exhibit achievements and projects I have earned or worked on in the past.

Since the primary work I do now are paid services with the company I work for, I am unable to display those projects on my personal webpage. 

My Leaflet API project is not supported in this repository, so it will open up to my hosted webpage.
